# Assignment 3 

## Team MT

**Simple convolutional neural network to perform classification** 
In this assignment, we will create a simple image classifier using convolutional neural network (CNN). We have used Python programming language along with TensorFlow and Keras to construct the convolutional neural network (CNN).

Time spent: **Since October 14,2023** (ongoing)

## Tasks 

The following **marked** tasks is completed:

There are mainly two tasks were given:

* [ ] Buiding a custom CNN
* [ ] Using fine-tuned state-of-the-art model
